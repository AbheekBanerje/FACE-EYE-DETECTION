# 👁️ Real-Time Face & Eye Detection Using OpenCV

This project implements a **real-time face and eye detection system** using **Haar Cascade Classifiers** in **OpenCV**. It can process live video from a webcam or images to detect faces and then locate eyes within those faces. This serves as a foundation for many computer vision applications including gaze tracking, emotion recognition, and user interaction systems.

---

## 🔍 Project Description

- The system uses **OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade models** for detecting frontal faces and eyes.
- Once a face is detected in an image or video frame, the eye detector is applied within the face region for precision.
- The result is displayed with rectangles drawn around detected faces and eyes in real time.
- Ideal as a beginner computer vision project or base for larger facial recognition systems.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Real-time detection via webcam or static image
- ✅ Face detection using `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
- ✅ Eye detection using `haarcascade_eye.xml`
- ✅ Fast and lightweight – runs on most systems without GPU

### ✅ What to Do Next:
- Save the above as `README.md` in your repo folder.
- Ensure your XML files are included in the repo (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` and `haarcascade_eye.xml`).
- Add screenshots or demo GIFs if available.

Let me know if you want a version with **live demo GIFs**, or **conversion to a GUI app** (e.g., using Streamlit).
